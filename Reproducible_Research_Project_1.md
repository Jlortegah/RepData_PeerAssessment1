###About
This is first project for the **Reproducible Research** course in Coursera's Data Science specialization track. The purpose of the project was to answer a series of questions using data collected from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.


##Synopsis
The purpose of this project is to practice:

* loading and preprocessing data
* imputing missing values
* interpreting data to answer research questions

## Data
The data for this assignment was downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

Download, unzip and load data into data frame `data`. 

```r
if(!file.exists("getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip")) {
        tempFile <- tempfile()
        download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",tempFile)
        unlink(tempFile)
}

data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day, create Histogram, and calculate mean and median.

```r
steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")
```

![](Reproducible_Research_Project_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png) 

```r
rmean <- mean(steps_by_day$steps)
rmedian <- median(steps_by_day$steps)
```

The `mean` is 1.0766189\times 10^{4} and the `median` is 10765.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

* Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis)
* Calculate average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).  
* Calculate 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps

```r
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)

plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
```

![](Reproducible_Research_Project_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png) 

```r
max_interval <- steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$steps),1]
```

The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the data set, containing the maximum number of steps is 835.

## Impute missing values.
* Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs).
* Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
* Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
* Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

```r
incomplete <- sum(!complete.cases(data))
imputed_data <- transform(data, steps = ifelse(is.na(data$steps), steps_by_interval$steps[match(data$interval, steps_by_interval$interval)], data$steps))
```

Zeroes were imputed for 10-01-2012 because it was the first day and would have been over 9,000 steps higher than the following day, which had only 126 steps. NAs then were assumed to be zeros to fit the rising trend of the data. 

```r
imputed_data[as.character(imputed_data$date) == "2012-10-01", 1] <- 0
```

Recount total steps by day and create Histogram. 

```r
steps_by_day_i <- aggregate(steps ~ date, imputed_data, sum)
hist(steps_by_day_i$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")

#Create Histogram to show difference. 
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="red", xlab="Number of Steps", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed", "Non-imputed"), col=c("blue", "red"), lwd=10)
```

![](Reproducible_Research_Project_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png) 

Calculate new mean and median for imputed data. 

```r
rmean.i <- mean(steps_by_day_i$steps)
rmedian.i <- median(steps_by_day_i$steps)
```

Calculate difference between imputed and non-imputed data.

```r
mean_diff <- rmean.i - rmean
med_diff <- rmedian.i - rmedian
```

Calculate total difference.

```r
total_diff <- sum(steps_by_day_i$steps) - sum(steps_by_day$steps)
```
* The imputed data mean is 1.0589694\times 10^{4}
* The imputed data median is 1.0766189\times 10^{4}
* The difference between the non-imputed mean and imputed mean is -176.4948964
* The difference between the non-imputed mean and imputed mean is 1.1886792
* The difference between total number of steps between imputed and non-imputed data is 7.5363321\times 10^{4}. Thus, there were 7.5363321\times 10^{4} more steps in the imputed data.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Created a plot to compare and contrast number of steps between the week and weekend. There is a higher peak earlier on weekdays, and more overall activity on weekends.  

```r
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
              "Friday")
imputed_data$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(imputed_data$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))

steps_by_interval_i <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, imputed_data, mean)

library(lattice)

xyplot(steps_by_interval_i$steps ~ steps_by_interval_i$interval|steps_by_interval_i$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")
```
